# 7) Comments and Reflections
Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.
• Was this your first time writing unit tests?
> Yes, this was my first time writing unit tests.

• On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the logic of testthat tests? (0 not at all, 10 very confusing)
> On a scale from 0 to 10, I would give it a 4. The logic of testthat tests wasn't too confusing because the format was like (input, expected) for the most part.

• Was this your first time working with ggvis?
> Yes, this was my first time working with ggvis. 

• On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the syntax of ggvis? (0 not at all, 10 very confusing)
> On a scale from 0 to 10, I would give it a 9. Because it was my first time using ggvis intensively, I found it relatively difficult to pick up. It was also harder than ggplot.

• Was this your first time working with conditional panels in shiny?
> Besides looking at it during lecture, it was my first time intensively working with conditional panels.

• On a scale from 0 to 10, how challenging you found to work with the conditional panels? (0 not at all, 10 very challenging)
> I would give it a 4. Since they are a part of Shiny, it wasn't that hard because it was like looking at set conditions.

• So far we’ve exposed you to three graphing paradigms in R: base plots, ggplot, and now ggvis. Which do you like the most and why?
> I like ggplot because the aesthetics are really fascinating and the syntax for ggplot didn't seem too complicated. I found it relatively easier to pick up than ggvis, and generating graphs seems more efficient than base plotting.

• Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?
> I mainly did an intensive Google search for help and went through all the past lecture slides on Shiny App.

• How much time did it take to complete this HW?
> It took me approximately 36 hours.

• What was the most time consuming part?
> The most time consuming part was generating the Shiny App.
