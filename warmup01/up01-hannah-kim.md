> Kimchi Fried Rice is great to make when you want to cook a Korean cuisine in a limited amount of time. There is not a special season of the year for it because it is a meal that can be eaten any time. You could make kimchi fried rice different by adding different kinds of meat along with the kimchi.

**Quadratic Equation**
======================

> *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

In algebra, a quadratic equation is any equation having the form *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0 where *x* represents an unknown, and *a*, *b*, and *c* represent known numbers such that *a* is not equal to 0. The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.

**Comments & Reflections**
==========================

-   *What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?* Creating the quadratic equation with roots was the hardest part of the warm-up.
-   *What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?* Writing down the recipe ingredients and inserting the picture of the food was easy since the markdown tutorials were straight forward.
-   *Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?* Yes, it's my first time using markdown. I like it because markdown is relatively easy to understand and read the code.
-   *If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?* N/A
-   *Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?* I needed a bit of help figuring out how to write the quadratic equation because I didn't realize we had to insert the dollar sign at the beginning. I googled the topics I was having trouble on.
-   *How much time did it take to complete this HW?* It took me around 35 minutes to complete the homework.
-   *What was the most time consuming part?* The most time consuming part was creating the quadratic sign with the roots.
